I found myself in an unusual situation: my girlfriend is gonna be away for a week, and almost all my friends are already busy for the weekend. This means that I'll have **a lot of lonely time**

What am I gonna do? The answer is easy: code as much as I can, and enjoy the sun that's been blessing London for the past days.

I've actually already started coding. I've just submitted a <a href="https://github.com/facebook/xctool/pull/106">PR to xctool</a>, let's see how it goes...

I'm gonna write again in a week and report my progress. Hopefully I'll have an almost ready iOS app, and an embryo of a Twitter-based web-app ready.
