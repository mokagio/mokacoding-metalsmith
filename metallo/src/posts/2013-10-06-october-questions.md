I'm reading [The Passionate Programmer](http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer), by [Chad Fowler](https://twitter.com/chadfowler) a book I reccomend to everyone, even if you're not really into coding. It's a set of tips on how to make the most out of your work as a software developer, all written in a easy to follow and engaging style.

One of the tips is called "Learn to Fish", and, quoting the famous saying [_"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."_](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/give_a_man_a_fish_and_you_feed_him_for_a_day._Teach_a_man_to_fish_and_you_feed_him_for_a_lifetime), it tells us about the importance of going deep in the understanding of our development tools, and business domain. The chapter ends by saying:

> Better yet, don't _ask_ to be taught -go learn yourself.

Chad Fowler also gives a tip on how to learn to fish:

> You can ask yourself two extremely useful questions about any given area to drill down into the murky layer: **How does it work?** and **Why does this (have to) happen?**

So this is what I'm gonna do (more) from now on. Spending time asking myself this type of questions around the technologies I use. And, inspired a bit by [Jennifer Dewalt (180 websites im 180 days)](http://jenniferdewalt.com/), I'm gonna track everything here. Let's get started!

##October's Questions

I'll start by trying understand better the tools I use in my daily job. At the moment I'm working as an iOS developer and next to the classic iOS SDK, Objective-C, Xcode and the iPhone Simulator, I'm making massive use of [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/), [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking), and [xctool](https://github.com/facebook/xctool).

I already have many questions on those technologies and tools, but one thing I've learned about propositions is **start small!**. So I'll start with only four questions. One per week, this shouldn't be hard to accomplish.

###1 - Xcode

**How does it...** stores the informations about project and workspace?

###2 - Objective-C

**Why does it...** allow us to use the messages syntax AND the dot notation to call methods?

###3 - CocoaPods

**How does it...** generate the workspace and manage the pods in it?

###4 - AFNetworking

**How does it...** wrap Apple's newtworking classes?
