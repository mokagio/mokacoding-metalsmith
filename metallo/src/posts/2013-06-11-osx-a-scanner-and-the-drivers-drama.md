Today I had to scan some documents, and I thought: it's gonna be super easy! I have a Mac, the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/consumer/print-solutions/print-solutions/colour-multifunction-printer/CLX-3305FW/SEE-support" target="_blank">printer</a> is made by Samsung, all reliable manufacturers, a piece of cake. Yes, I know <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/printers">printers are evil objects</a>, but I needed to use the scanner part, what could have gone wrong? The answer is... the classic missing drivers!!!

<p style="text-align:left;">It took me a while but I finally found the drivers, in the least expectable place, an <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/dl905">official Apple page</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This is the end of the post. I hope one day another young and desperate guy will land on this page and find a smile, other than the damn drivers!</p>
