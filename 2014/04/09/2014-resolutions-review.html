<ul>
<li>5 tweets sharing tech articles I&#39;ve read a week.</li>
<li>3 days of exercise, or at least <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/?_r=0">7 minutes workout</a>, a week.</li>
<li>1 original tech blogpost per month.</li>
<li>1 social event for developers a month.</li>
<li>1 tech book every quarter.</li>
<li>1 PR per quarter</li>
<li>2 decent (&gt; 100 stars on GitHub) open source softwares during the year</li>
<li>1 new programming language learned during the year.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first quarter of 2014 is gone, and I feel like it&#39;s time to review how I&#39;ve been doing.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve kept track of all my <em>achievements</em> on a <code>.md</code> file on my Dropbox, but I guessed moving the system <a href="https://github.com/mokagio/2014-Resolutions">on GitHub</a> would be better, and more readable.</p>
<p>My only big failure is with the tweets, I see to be very good at adding articles to my Pocket list, but no so much at archiving them.</p>
<p>The point of a retrospective is to improve the next iteration. So taking inspiration from <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/remy-sharp/2014-january-3">this post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/rem">Remy Sharp</a> that ends saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Donâ€™t make it hard to achieve, make it hard to give up.</p>
<p>Plan to fail. Plan to cheat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll <strong>tune my weekly articles target from 5 to 3</strong>, and celebrate chocolate all the extra ones.</p>
<p>Apart from not being very good at reading blogs I&#39;ve been able to tick all the other checkboxes in my resolutions lists, and I&#39;ve learned <strong>a lot</strong> doing so, specially by contributing to <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/liftoff">liftoff</a>, a tool to setup new Xcode projects without the usual pain written in Ruby. I&#39;ve also choose what&#39;s my new programming language gonna be, Clojure! But before digging into it I need to clear a backlog of iOS/Ruby projects.</p>
<p>I feel like a mention is needed for the exercises. I&#39;m using <a href="https://7minuteworkout.jnj.com/">yet another 7 minutes workout app</a>, that I found really good because it has other exercises apart from the canonical 7 minutes, and let&#39;s you build your own sets. I&#39;ve also got into the habit of doing a quick <em>moving around</em> almost every hour while at work, part of it because of the reminders in the <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nikeplus-fuelband">Nike FuelBand SE</a>. I could be running down and up the stairs (we&#39;re at the 4th floor), doing front squats, or something with elastic bands. Those tiny breaks make me feel better and more energetic, and help focus back on work.</p>
<p>Although the biggest gain I had from sticking to my resolutions was the value of <strong>community events</strong>. I&#39;m very lucky to be living in London, and being surrounded by amazing people in the tech scene. The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NSLondon/">NSLondon</a> meetup has been my favourite monthly event so far, and I had a chance to meet <a href="https://github.com/mattt">Mattt Thompson</a> and <a href="https://github.com/irrationalfab">Fabio Pelosin</a>, two developers that inspire me every day, and get in touch with new ideas or tools every time. </p>
<p>Sometime it&#39;s easy to get lost between lines of code and impersonal names such as <em>composition</em>, <em>proxy</em>, <em>mock</em>, but the fact is that software is <strong>made by people</strong> and the real engine that makes our software better is the interaction with other individuals, exchanging opinions, ideas, and a good dose of nonesense!</p>
<p><em>Enjoy the next three quarters of 2014</em></p>
