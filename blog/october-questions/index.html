It&#39;s a set of tips on how to make the most out of your work as a software developer, all written in a easy to follow and engaging style.</p>
<p>One of the tips is called &quot;Learn to Fish&quot;, and, quoting the famous saying <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/give_a_man_a_fish_and_you_feed_him_for_a_day._Teach_a_man_to_fish_and_you_feed_him_for_a_lifetime"><em>&quot;Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.&quot;</em></a>, it tells us about the importance of going deep in the understanding of our development tools, and business domain. The chapter ends by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Better yet, don&#39;t <em>ask</em> to be taught -go learn yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chad Fowler also gives a tip on how to learn to fish:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can ask yourself two extremely useful questions about any given area to drill down into the murky layer: <strong>How does it work?</strong> and <strong>Why does this (have to) happen?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this is what I&#39;m gonna do (more) from now on. Spending time asking myself this type of questions around the technologies I use. And, inspired a bit by <a href="http://jenniferdewalt.com/">Jennifer Dewalt (180 websites im 180 days)</a>, I&#39;m gonna track everything here. Let&#39;s get started!</p>
<h2 id="october-s-questions">October&#39;s Questions</h2>
<p>I&#39;ll start by trying understand better the tools I use in my daily job. At the moment I&#39;m working as an iOS developer and next to the classic iOS SDK, Objective-C, Xcode and the iPhone Simulator, I&#39;m making massive use of <a href="http://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking">AFNetworking</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/xctool">xctool</a>.</p>
<p>I already have many questions on those technologies and tools, but one thing I&#39;ve learned about propositions is <strong>start small!</strong>. So I&#39;ll start with only four questions. One per week, this shouldn&#39;t be hard to accomplish.</p>
<h3 id="1-xcode">1 - Xcode</h3>
<p><strong>How does it...</strong> stores the informations about project and workspace?</p>
<h3 id="2-objective-c">2 - Objective-C</h3>
<p><strong>Why does it...</strong> allow us to use the messages syntax AND the dot notation to call methods?</p>
<h3 id="3-cocoapods">3 - CocoaPods</h3>
<p><strong>How does it...</strong> generate the workspace and manage the pods in it?</p>
<h3 id="4-afnetworking">4 - AFNetworking</h3>
<p><strong>How does it...</strong> wrap Apple&#39;s newtworking classes?</p>
