I can really say I&#39;ve grown a lot during year. In this post I&#39;m gonna try to do a quick <em>retrospective</em> on 2013, in full agile fashion. Finally I&#39;m gonna set some expectations for 2014.</p>
<h3 id="retrospectives-on-2013">Retrospectives on 2013</h3>
<h3 id="what-s-been-good">What&#39;s been good</h3>
<h4 id="love-it-or-leave-it-">Love it or leave it!</h4>
<p>I was able to overcome some fears and leave <a href="http://memrise.com">Memrise</a>, my first job and first love in London, when I realized I wasn&#39;t loving it anymore, and that my work there was teaching me less and less things week after week. Although I have to admit that to change job in a city like London, where the market is so vibrant, and developers receive many emails a week from recruiters you don&#39;t really need to be brave, just smart.</p>
<h4 id="podcasts-and-screencasts">Podcasts and Screencasts</h4>
<p>In the last quarter of the year I decided to optimize those dead moments of my day, like walking to work or eating, trying to learn a bit of stuff in a chilled way. I therefore started following a number of <a href="http://www.mokacoding.com/2013/11/20/podcasts.html">podcasts</a> and screencasts about technology, mainly iOS and Ruby. It&#39;s a good way to keep my mind busy and pick up some good things without really focusing. It&#39;s also an healthier alternative to watching Dexter at dinner time and getting caught into the episodes till 3 in the morning!</p>
<h4 id="standing-desk">Standing desk</h4>
<p>At the beginning of the year, thanks to the example of my colleague <a href="http://adamj.eu">Adam</a>, I picked up the habit of working standing. It&#39;s amazing! Not a back pain or a position problem, and I always feel very energetic! Plus... <a href="http://lifehacker.com/standing-for-3-hours-a-day-on-weekdays-is-like-running-1447078889"><em>&quot;Standing on Weekdays Burns Calories Like Running 10 Marathons a Year!&quot;</em></a></p>
<h3 id="what-could-be-improved">What could be improved</h3>
<h4 id="reading-books-and-blog-posts">Reading books and blog posts</h4>
<p>The internet is full of resources and informations, and so are the libraries. When 2013 started I wanted to read many technical books and blogs. I&#39;ve skimmed through a handful of technical books, and except for <a href="http://nshipster.com/">NSHipster</a> and <a href="http://objc.io">objc.io</a> I mainly just put links in my <a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> read it later list, without picking them out anymore.</p>
<h4 id="looking-at-the-source-code">Looking at the source code</h4>
<p>I believe looking at the source code of libraries you&#39;re using is really important for two reasons, first because it provides a better understanding of how things work, second because it&#39;s usually a good way to pick up good coding styles. That said I spent most of 2013 looking at the source code of a library only when something didn&#39;t work properly.</p>
<h4 id="estimates">Estimates</h4>
<p>It took me a while to understand that the time I estimate in my head it&#39;s not gonna be the one it will take me to actually do the job, and therefore increase it of a good .5 or more before writing it down on the task ticket.</p>
<h4 id="blogging">Blogging</h4>
<p>When I started this blog, on <a href="http://amokafullofstuff.wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> at the time, I wanted to do a post per week. I posted 21 posts, of which 5 are just a collection of things learned during the month. That, like the estimates, was clearly shooting to high...</p>
<h3 id="what-has-been-bad">What has been bad</h3>
<h4 id="i-worked-too-much">I worked too much</h4>
<p>February has been hell, I worked all the weekends of the month, on a rush to complete and app that got taken off the store after a month or so. That was bad for sooo many reasons. I was always working in a rush, skipping unit tests, making silly mistakes, writing poor code, and I didn&#39;t get almost any free time to relax or to work on personal projects, every thing for a product that just a couple of thousands UK iPhone users downloaded, and that&#39;s not even online anymore.</p>
<h4 id="at-the-edge-of-the-community">At the edge of the community</h4>
<p>I&#39;ve been at the edge of the community. I&#39;ve lived for one year in a city like London, where there&#39;s a meetup every night and a hackthon every weekend, but I&#39;ve attended only a few of those. I&#39;ve also produced little open source software, just a couple of not really maintained iOS libraries, and a handful of PR.</p>
<h4 id="late-ios-7-adoption">Late iOS 7 adoption</h4>
<p>I&#39;ve started looking into the iOS 7 SDK news at the end of August, joining the party late and having, still now, to work hard to catch up.</p>
<h4 id="not-enough-tdd">Not enough TDD</h4>
<p>I&#39;ve let the hurries of my CEO drive the development of my projects, rather than the tests and a clear roadmap.</p>
<h4 id="haven-t-learned-any-new-language-">Haven&#39;t learned any new language!</h4>
<p>Nor even tried something new! I realized this only now writing this blogpost, and I feel really bad about it.</p>
<h4 id="didn-t-exercise">Didn&#39;t exercise</h4>
<p>I put aside swimming and gym to focus on work... That&#39;s not really healthy and I&#39;m starting to feeling and seeing the consequences of 6 month of almost sedentary life style already.</p>
<h3 id="2014-propositions">2014 propositions</h3>
<p>After having looked back at the 2013 with a critical eye, I can say that on 2014 I&#39;ll <strong>set the bar low, but jump higher</strong>. I&#39;m not gonna say or write something like <em>&quot;I&#39;m gonna write a blogpost every week&quot;</em>, or <em>&quot;I&#39;m gonna wake up at 6 every morning to do pushups, like Bruce Waine&quot;</em>. I&#39;ll set the bar low, <em>&quot;I&#39;m gonna write a blogpost every month&quot;</em>, and I&#39;m gonna try to jump higher than it every time. I&#39;m also <strong>not gonna be a slave of my daily job</strong>, and be sure to have enough free time to both work on my own things and just chill. I&#39;ll try to <strong>expand my technical knowledge both deeper and wider</strong>, deeper in what I work on daily, and wider towards new tools. Finally I&#39;m going to be more involved in the community, because those few time I&#39;ve been at a conference or a meetup I&#39;ve always came home with something new to try out and with new friends to talk to.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s some goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 tweets sharing tech articles I&#39;ve read a week.</li>
<li>3 days of exercise, or at least <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/?_r=0">7 minutes workout</a>, a week.</li>
<li>1 original tech blogpost per month.</li>
<li>1 social event for developers a month.</li>
<li>1 tech book every quarter.</li>
<li>1 PR per quarter</li>
<li>2 decent (&gt; 100 stars on GitHub) open source softwares during the year</li>
<li>1 new programming language learned during the year.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>That&#39;s it, as always in the first days of January I feel energetic and unbeatable. I&#39;ll try to keep up to those resolution, we&#39;ll see how it went in 12 month.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
